# Excel-Project
 Attrition rate analysis of employees in an organization.
 Used advanced Excel functions, created a pivot table and designed an interactive dashboard.
 Generated insights that the attrition rate is 16% of the total employees. Single employees aged between 25 to 37 are more likely to leave the job, having only a bachelors 
 degree. Most of the attrition happening is from R & D department.
